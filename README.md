## Summary
My passion is puzzles and I developed a love of coding through writing simple puzzle solvers. Having found previous roles in climbing and accounting tedious, I decided to take this love of coding and build a career out of it. For the last few years, I have been studying programming and building web applications. While this has been valuable, I believe that working alone was limiting my development as a software engineer. I joined Digital Futures for the opportunity to work with, and learn from, others. I hope to continue my development, with a focus on writing clean, efficient and well-tested code.
